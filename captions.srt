In the last two lessons, you learned about blah blah blah

1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
But browser vendors couldn't agree on a codec

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
and older browsers don't support &lt;video&gt; at all.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
This means &lt;video src="myfile.mp4" /&gt; doesn't work ...

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
until now.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
Introducing MediaElement.js, an HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; player

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
that looks and works the same in every browser (even iPhone and Android).

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
For older browsers, it has custom Flash and Silverlight plugins

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
that fully replicate the HTML5 MediaElement API
